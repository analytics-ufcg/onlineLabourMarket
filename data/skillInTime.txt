Currently when the customer submits the form, the form's data is sent to 5 different emails. Everything works well but we would like the form to now send a confirmation email of the appointment to the customer. Basically a reminder email. The confirmation/reminder email should provide: Customers contact info, appointment time/day, and general contact information to our store. Thank you for looking.

We can use movement, slideshow, and other things as long as the file size is below 40k each. No sound, but video can be used if muted. We prefer a slideshow type of banner to be able to give more information in such a small space but we are open to suggestions. While we prefer to do business with US-based companies we will be somewhat flexible on that based on previous work and price.&|&Design & Multimedia&|&SAnimation;Graphic Design;Banner Ads&|&2
